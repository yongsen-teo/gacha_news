# Youtube Video Summarizer (specifically for Gacha gaming youtube videos) 

## Why  
- realised that gacha games and youtube channels have a lot of information jammed pack into a long video and sometimes the content creators take too long to get to the point
- created a gacha news summarizer to give me a concise summary of the important information needed

## What 
- A youtube video summarizer powered by Anthropic Claude (mainly) and also OpenAI models
- It will take in the video URL + the video title (currently you have to copy and paste it sorry)
- Then the video summarizer will give you a structured summarised notes on the video content
