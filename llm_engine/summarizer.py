Hoyoverse is a gacha-centric company that made Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail. These games are usually free to play games with pay to win mechanics such as drawing for limited characters that are powerful in the game. \n\nThe pay-to-win mechanics work by allowing players to buy premium currency in game using real money to pull for characters. The premium currency is still available to be earned in game but it will take a considerable amount of time to grind for them for free to play players. \n\nMost content creators will create guides whenever a new character comes out and it helps the viewer decide if they are worth drawing for. In addition, they will create shorter information video that clears a specific question the user might have. These questions are catered more towards optimizing the grinding process and if the player is \"wasting time\" on unnecessary tasks in the game.\n\nHere are the character names in Zenless Zone Zero, MAKE SURE to use the correct name whenever a similar sounding or misspelled name comes out. \n\n- Ellen \n- Anbi \n- Sokaku \n- Lycaon \n- Rena \n- Lucy \n- Zhu Yuan \n- Piper \n- Grace \n\n</game_information>\n\nYour task is to read through the transcript and understand if the video belongs to the following categories: \n- Character Guide video \n- Tips and tricks video \n\nAfter determining the category, use the markdown format below that corresponds to the category to summarize the transcript, make sure your points under the headers are in bullet points: \n<character_guide_markdown_format>\n## How the character works \n- a short description on how the skills work \n- how combos work \n- what to do in combat \n\n## Passive skill \n- short description of the basic skills \n\n## Basic Attack \n... \n\n## Special and EX Skill \n... \n\n## Ultimate ability \n... \n\n===\n\n## Best W-engine (weapon) and Gear (Disc Drive) \n- best premium option W-engine\n- F2P alternative \n\n- Best in slot gear \n- which stat to prioritise \n\n## Team comps \n- which teammates to bring \n- how to combo their skills and do an optimal rotation \n</character_guide_markdown_format>\n\n<tips_and_tricks_markdown_format>\n## Key information the video was trying to say \n- what question is stated in the video title and did the content creator answer them? \n- the video title could be clickbait titles with warning terms like \"DO NOT WASTE TIME ...\", you should rephrase this and turn it into an information tip \n\n## How important is this information and who is it for \n- how crucial is knowing this information, does it affect our game progress that much \n- who is the target players for this video (for example, beginners?

[Best Combos, Builds & Teams] | Zenless Zone Zero\n</video_title>\n\n<video_transcript>\nEllen is a monstrous DPS and the first limited character for zenis Zone Zero's launch as a fighting game player h i I had to do it for the one time I'm not going to lie to you it's easy to see why so many of us consider Ellen the strongest DPS currently in the game but what's more surprising to me is people are saying this without fully understanding how to play her I mean most of you are still doing this in today's video I'm going to show you how destructive her play style is what kind of damage potential she has and most importantly how to access that damage potential on your own of course I'll go over the typical stuff such as best weapons disc drives teams and mindscape so if you want to understand exactly what you're doing with Ellen this video is for you and without further Ado first up I want to break down Ellen's kit and how her damage works I'm sure it seems simple to most but surprisingly that's not what the survey says everything Ellen wants to do revolves around this scissor Stacks over 70% of her damage is locked behind this meter manage mechanic if you suck at this you will never see Ellen's true potential but building Stacks is incredibly easy Once you learn when how and what you gain Stacks from your most important and quickest way to gain scissor Stacks will be from the roaming State or the hunt if your game's in Japanese Ellen's hunt State gives her a slightly increased running speed fake eye frames access to a new move and the ability to gain Stacks a single strike grants you one stack of flash freeze while a fully charged strike provides three I'll explain this in a later segment but you don't always need to shoot for a fully charged scissor strike once you start to fully understand Ellen's game plan you will eventually become more comfortable recognizing when you can capitalize on a single stack or fully charged strike and yeah this is without M1 ascended with those previously mentioned flash freezes Ellen gains access to over 70% damage that I mentioned earlier through the use of her enhanced basic attacks her move set is relatively the same except for basic Attack 3 which gives you a fully invulnerable dive from front to back now this doesn't mean that you should never use her unenhanced basic attacks I mean there are some minute situations where you'd be forced or want to use a basic attack most of the time being cancel opportunities to gain a stack juggling Properties or you managed your meter poorly after that you have a special attack tail swipe and funnily enough you want to learn how to weave this into your standard b&bs BNB equaling bread and butter combo that that literally is something from fighting games I don't want you guys to think that I'm doing the meme cuz like I'm serious right now the normal special move is a great way to instantly trigger her core passes additional ability Rising storm and 3% is small come on guys like that's that's not really that small right three 3% like that's pretty big and and you know 3% * 10 equal 30% so use it when you need it EXT swipe uses 40 energy which you can build with the B&B that I'm going to show you in just a little bit this gives you one flash freeze charge after hitting an enemy and shortcuts your basic attack streen so you can immediately follow up her ex special with a basic attack three lastly is the follow-up attack shark Nami this holds all the same properties as the previous move but with a fork ton of extra damage she even yells this out like a super Senti special [Music] move Ellen's also fully invulnerable when using both versions of her ex now since this is a beginner's guide I'll keep this part out of the video to not overwhelm you guys but using the fact her ex special gives you a flash freeze and it also shortcuts the basic attack three you essentially have an infinite amount of flash freezes until you run out of EX meter so now that I've gone over the basics of her kit let me break down a stronger way to maximize Ellen's potential once you understand that the basic principle behind her kit is to obtain and control the amount of flash freezes Ellen has at any given time that's when you can start messing around with player expression and how you want to play the agent agent character unit it doesn't matter what you call it a big part of what makes Ellen Ellen is the infinite Dodge counters and quick damage she has access to most of your focus should be on a hit and run play style until you set yourself up to dish out a stronger combo instead of using Parry every time you see a golden flash consider the fact that you may or may not have energy or Flash freezes beforehand the reason I say this is because there are times when you should be setting yourself up for the big burst combo and then getting maximum damage from said big dick damage combo it sucks when you stun a boss but have no energy deciel or Flash freezes to truly capitalize on that moment if you're not familiar with Dash cancels or any cancel for that matter I suggest you start practicing now Ellen's Basic 2 is the perfect move to dash cancel out of leading in the roaming State around frame three or so and setting up a switch cancel for your teammate in order to gain a full stack of flash freeze or scissor Stacks Ellen needs to hold the attack for about 2 and 1 12ish seconds which is kind of long when you're in the middle of an action game but one of the ways that I found to reduce the lingering effect of this move is to just switch Tech out of it if you hold the charge input for about 1 and 1 half seconds or until you see the big glint you can switch Tech here into another unit and begin their combos set play or to initiate either defensive mechanic meanwhile Ellen will still complete the fully charged scissor strike resulting in three flash freezes without needing to be as vulnerable on the field your second most common way will be gaining the Quick Charge status which is a short 5-second buff unique to Ellen this turns that almost 3se second charge time into about half a second and thankfully if you play Ellen the way she wants to be played you'll always be full on Stacks because of this quick assist and perfect Dodge are your best friend each of these give Ellen the Quick Charge state for about 5 seconds and once you get comfortable doing this you'll be using it a lot more and you guys remember that term Negative Edge that I used for weathering waves okay well zenas technically has that too although you don't use it in the same way now I've been testing some things but reu actually discovered that if you quick assist or counter Dodge off of Ellen you can actually hold left or right whatever Direction you want and she will instantly go into roaming State without you having to do the attack if you do it this way you can immediately cancel that into the hold attack which means you're guaranteed to get that5 second free full charge almost instantly practicing the cancel timing for this basically makes basic so that you can initiate when and how you control your meter and you're always fully stacked so now you never really have an excuse to keep mashing regular attacks unless you're bad a standard BNB that you can fool around with is something like this and that combo results in a guaranteed days on basic enemies three flash freezes one ex bar and an immediate chain attack to start cycling your bus from the support using Reena as an example this B&B wipes out any mob plus CC's whatever is left over for Reena to Baton Pass a quick assist in the Ellen which now technically counts as your first quick charge and ex skill right off the bat once you hit stages focusing on the big boss you'll want to pay attention on what kind of elite it is some Elites only give you two chain attacks while the others give you three regardless of how you land it your burst combo is probably the easiest thing in the world chain attack old ex skill basic Attack 3 ex skill ex skill 2 b basic Attack 3 Dash attack cancel heavy scissor strike switch Tech I know that probably sounds like a lot but you can see me doing it on screen as well as the button inputs to do that and that doesn't matter if you're on controller or keyboard you just have to know what your buttons are get familiar with these two Combos and when you should be doing them then eventually you'll start messing around with stuff that is still practical but just looks really cool to do [Music] because I know most of you guys are freeo play I rarely find it useful for me to go over the copies of a character not because they're bad but because most of you won't get Beyond an M2 on purpose in the first place and it is for that reason alone I'm only going to break down how these give mild changes to the character's damage but drastically change her overall access to that damage and if you haven't caught on by now most of what I'm talking about here at least in Zen list is the access to set damage because surprise surprise nothing is guaranteed in this game unless you earn it M1 turns her Artic ambush from Gaining one stack to three stacks and from Three Stacks to six Stacks thus opening the window for new combos to be created thanks to the fact that you're gaining everything you need from an immediate Dash attack she also gains up to 12% crit rate just for using flash freezes which is basically permanent at this point cuz you're doing that anyway mind you all of this is at a base charge level imagine how fast you can gain six Stacks from the Quick Charge status M2 is something purely for sauce remember that shortcut where ex tail swipe allowed you to immediately follow up with a basic Attack 3 well now M2 creates an actual combo chain going from EXT swipe to basic Attack 3 in the shark Nami then you repeat the process until you run out of meter the cool thing about this is normally ex special ex special 2 sharkn Nami takes up 80 to 120 meter which means you you probably will never get that back to back to back but doing it this way now allows you to still get out three of them instead of just one shark Nami is her most powerful attack and now the fact that she gains up to 60% raw crit damage on top of m1's crit rate yeah M2 Ellen has the highest raw crit values in the game before any gear comes into play you honestly don't need either of these but I absolutely want M2 with the largest chunk of the guide out of the way let's run down her preferred gear before we get into the best teams first up W engines but most of ver are used to what brings the most damage or boosted stats I strongly believe Zen Zone Zero's gear system is way closer to honai impact thirds and for that which W engine you choose can completely change how you play the character or rather what you're able to do in the first place kicking things off deep C visitor is Ellen's signature weapon and of course that's her best netting an over 20% damage difference between most other weapons deep SE grants a free crit rate up to almost 50% and 25% ice damage Unconditional by the way and you get all of this just for playing the character correctly I'm honestly surprised they didn't attach a new move to this thing the brimstone is her next best option as a standard srank weapon and that part is important srank while it offers a huge attack and mega attack percent buff to the wear the Buffs themselves are completely dependent on ramping up a bunch of basic attacks that makes the Buffs a little too conditional because now you have too many situations where you'll have a burst combo available but need to waste time spamming basic attacks before doing any higher damaging combos someone who's like uh a master at switch Tech could possibly circumvent this with amazing execution but again too conditional lastly we have Starlight engine which is going to be the L cone that I recommend being completely free to play and an overall solid option for attack agents in general why did I say lcom bro that was my star brain I meant W engine Starlight engine with a 25% unconditional attack percent buff and once you reach S5 you'll get an additional 19% on top of that the 19% is conditional though forcing you to trigger a Dodge counter or quick assist every 12 seconds in Ellen's case this isn't the worst thing in the world and I actually believe it's better universally compared to the brimstone none of these conditions will ever be fulfilled if you're just face rolling the keyboard now I'm lazy and strongly dislike math so all of these numbers are from Pride win and not me I can do it but do I I want to absolutely the rolling into the disc drive section I believe my take on this is a little nuanced while I do believe that there's a clear best disc drive when it comes to damage or Stat boost I also believe that there is so much free form style in this current version of the game that the disc drives just slightly alter what you want to do now I love the four-piece Woodpecker on my Ellen but some of my homies love four piece polar metal this game is centered around optimizing when and how you do your Combos and way less about what most players are confusing a rotation of be each disc drive has its own benefits and dictates what you value more from Ellen woodpecker Electro is the overall best one giving you the most universal damage due to the fact a well-built Ellen will almost always crit polar metal could be next due to the fact that over 70% of your damage derives from basic attacks but then puffer Electro basically holds the same value when it comes to your burst damage specifically so it's kind of a coin toss in the air on which one you just happen to have the better stats for or which one you prefer playing you're more of a mashing type player then puffer Electro might be for you because you're going to mash your way into a burst combo but if you're a little more calculated and you're not really worried about all that then you can get away with polar metal at the end of the day it really just comes down to which one you have the best set for and then you just slap it on your Ellen she's so strong she's going to do whatever she wants when she wants how she wants regarding the two-piece Drive option I'd say it's dealer's choice of any of these as they have great two-piece bonuses but hormone Punk is another great option for the 10% attack to keep it short and simple your desired main stats will be crit rate or damage on the fourth disc whichever you need to make up for ice damage or attack percent on disc 5 but pin ratio could work here depending on if you have better substats for it or not and lastly attack percent on dis six the order of the drive is counterclockwise by the way and and finally at the end of the guide we can smash out the best teams for Ellen realistically this is broken down into two major Arch types though free to play and not free to play as of right now the mass populace agrees that the mono ice team is Ellen's strongest team and it's really hard to argue against it from a partner standpoint lyen is without a shadow of a doubt her best friend he's the best stunner in the game he has an amazing combination of slow and fast attacks great launchers 25% ice shred fast freeze Combos and he's the only character in the game to increase the days multiplier up by 35% the two of them separately already have some of the most powerful passive abilities in the game but making those abilities mutually resonate is just absolutely ridiculous their Synergy at this current point in time is unmatched and it's honestly because of these two alone that your choice of a third character is a lot more open the mono ice team rounds it off with Saku who is an amazing partner for the team at M1 but a way better support unit in M6 she offers the team an impressive flat attack buff upwards of about 1,000 that if you set it up correctly could easily take Ellen from 3K to 4K she boosts the entire team's damage even further with a 20% ice damage buff and racks up the freeze anomaly even faster than like it I haven't even mentioned all of the different switch Tech each of them Grant each other so with this there's no wonder why it's being recognized as the best but I still believe personally speaking by the way Reena is the best option in this slot reena's kid is impressive by itself establishing around 70% pin ratio for the entire team to benefit from ridiculous shock anomaly potential quick assist opportunities one of the only longrange characters in the game decent crowd control and access to the super powerful disorder reaction at first I thought keeping all this stuff up was going to be pretty difficult but after playing the team for about a week it's practically the easiest thing in the world to do you literally just switch Tech a lot now the freeto playay team holds the same concept but you're replacing like with AMI I say Ami because Cola could be used but that puts them in the same position as Lykan you either have her or you don't with amb this still allows you to keep certain things from the premium team like easy launchers disorder quick days buildup quick assist opportunities and the fact that she's free means you're more than likely going to get some extra copies of her instead of an srank then being free to play so Kaku obviously makes the best choice here regardless of what team you build one of these doesn't outright right stomp on the other if we're looking at this from a purely DPS perspective then one of them clears in 59 seconds while the other clears in 61 it's honestly not worth stressing over Dude pick whatever you want after all that is said and done Ellen is an amazing character and easily one of my favorites in the game her play style promotes a good mix of strong and fast attacks Dash cancels switch Tech and constantly looking for new ways to combo from a teammate or herself if you've been questioning whether or not Ellen is worth it to you I'd say go for but don't let me be the determining factor for your account Zas is just barely breathing and we've already seen some incredible looking characters coming in the next couple of months if you've enjoyed today's video don't

more damage here is the standard Allen combo versus an allen combo that skips the Saku chain attack the stand duration ends as soon as the yellow days number appears because even though the damage multiplier is still visible here you're no longer getting the damage increase normal combo gives alen around 11 seconds of DPS during stun next we have the chain attack skip combo this chain skip combo gave alen 15 seconds during ST which is a pretty big difference if you're like me and mainly geared Ellen this can actually increase your damage by almost 20% during the St phase what is causing this and how does it work hello everyone this is swedy so I used to happily press all the qtes whenever I stand an enemy to trigger all the chain attacks however I noticed that saku's chain attack took forever and after testing I realized that it can actually end up decreasing my damage while chain attacks can recover assist points I frame attacks and in general they usually look and feel good to cast but the one thing the game doesn't tell you is that the enemy's Days bar decreases during the time you're casting all your cool flashy skills it's not evident either because it looks like each chain attack resets the Days bar but let's take a closer look I found that after the Days bar hits 100 but before you trigger any qtes you have around 1 second of free time that does not count towards the standun duration during this time the days number will randomly change and after the 1 second it will start decreasing normally from 99 this free second is also applied after any qte is triggered even if you don't act on it depending on the enemy and your rotation you'll have anywhere from 8 to 20 seconds of total standun duration as an example let's use this particular enemy after getting the days to 100 I will trigger the chain attack qte prompt but I will ignore the qte prompts and let them expire the chain attack QT prompt does freeze time here we are getting the one free second from the QT triggers that I mentioned earlier we can see from the timer that the total stand duration is around 12 seconds now let's see what happens when I use saku's chain attack originally I assumed that chain attacks were free and the the sense that the enemy's Days bar would be paused and not decreased during the skill cast however as you can see here the total St duration after using saku's chain attack is the exact same as the previous scenario as it turns out all the animations of your character's chain attacks count towards the total stand duration so all the time you spend using each character's chain attack directly cuts into the time you can spend on your main DPS since soak spins for over 3 seconds that means it's 3 seconds less for Ellen to deal damage during her best burst window some people might say well so kaku's chain attack can do damage too and while that is true saku's chain attack especially early to mid game will do only a fraction of the damage of Ellen's combo so increasing saku's damage from let's say 5 to 10 will be a much less overall damage increase and increasing Allen's damage from 50 to 70 interestingly when the enemy is Frozen the days number actually freezes as well until they naturally shatter or are Shattered by an attack so freezing can be helpful to extend your stand duration here's the rotation I recommend for getting the highest Allen up time during enemy stands ideally before the enemy is sted you trigger so kaku's fly the flag to buff alen and then you stun with likeon if you have him for the extra stun multiplier qte onto alen and ignore any follow-up qte prompts so you can still stay on field with her during this time you can also take a look here if the enemy's attribute anomaly circle is almost full you can save your Ellen ultimate for after it freezes since freeze does pause the day bar and Ellen's ultimate has a long animation you can wait to cast your ultimate and extend your stun duration a little more this way optimizing for alen's onfield time during enemy stun has honestly came in very handy in both Hollow zero and shuu defense not only are the enemies a m during stun they also take 1.5 to 2x more damage during this time thanks to the stun multiplier so it can often save you anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds some disclaimers so kaku's chain attack is useful in grouping smaller enemies together so if there are lots of ads feel free to use it as a cc also not everyone's chain attacks take as long as okaku so you can decide whether to use them based on how long they take and what they do Ambi and ni are super quick for instance so I would generally always use those thank you for watching I hope this video helps like And subscribe if you enjoyed the content as it helps my channel a lot I'm planning to make a video about some useful Allen tips next I wanted to go over this finding because it was really interesting and unexpected to learn and it did make a difference for me when I was tackling shuu defense it's also helpful knowledge to keep in mind for When Future characters release with long chain attacks honestly I hope they change it you're supposed to feel good about finally stunning the enemy and getting to execute all your cool combos but the way it works currently it's a bit of it feels bad sometimes and you want to think about which chain attacks are actually worth using given the time tradeoff at the end of the day though I wouldn't worry about it too much chain attacks are fun to use and as long as you're having fun that's the most important in the game not necessarily optimizing your combos or increasing your damage thank you for listening again I'll see you on stream or in my next video\n</video_transcript>\n"

It’s finally time to check \nout Grace, and by that I mean today we’ll   be looking at how to play her optimally, how \nto build her properly, and all things teams.   She is a very fast paced and high damage \nunit, coming in field to spam out Shocks,   weaving in abilities with ease, and swapping \nback out whilst letting her Anomaly damage   destroy enemies. So if this vid helped, like and \nsub and share to help me out, and let’s begin. Grace is an Electric Anomaly unit, one of our only \ntwo Anomalies as of 1.0. She has a decently high   base atk of 826 and she scales on Anomaly Mastery, \nwhich is the stat that increases how fast you   apply your element’s Anomaly. She is the only unit \nthat does this so far, giving her an insane base   AM of 151 at level 60, which is already a 1.5x \nmultiplier to her elemental application speed. On the UI you’ll see 8 things in the top left. \nI think they’re grenades. These are in fact her   Zap stacks, linked to her Core Passive. When \nbasic attacking or Dash attacking and hitting   an enemy with physical damage, you will gain 1 \nstack of Zap. Since she shoots her gun like a   pro and has a wide spread of bullets per attack, \nthis means her attacks can accumulate multiple   stacks of Zap in one move. Anyway when you reach \n8 stacks you’ll get a nice visual indicator top   left but also on her grenade stash on her belt. \nAnd her next Special or EX Special, either work,   will have their anomaly buildup increased by \na large percentage. This is another separate   multiplier to how fast you apply anomaly, and \nat level 7 core passive this will increase the   buildup by over double. So you bet we’ll want to \nmaximize this, and we will see how to in a bit. So onto her basic attack string. She has a 4 \nattack string. A left to right bullet spray, then   the opposite, then a cool spin and kneel where she \nthrows a grenade, and then a fancy midair spin.  This 3rd attack’s grenade does do electric \nDMG and applies a slight amount of anomaly.  You can input movement whilst using basic \nattacks just like Zhu Yuan and she will   perform special moving attacks slightly \ndifferent to our normal Dash Attacks.  And finally her basic combo will not be \ninterrupted by specials, EX Specials,   Dodges, Dash Attacks or even Dodge Counters. This \nmakes her very fluid in combat and very satisfying   to use. You can do your full combo without having \nenemies smack you around and resetting everything. So let’s see, just like with Zhu Yuan, how \ninputting movements during basic attacks   can change Grace’s basic string.\nBasic 1, Moving Basic, Basic just   weaves in a moving basic, and so it adds \nanother attack inbetween basics 1 and 2.  Basic 2, Moving Basic, Basic does the same, so \nyou get an extra attack again in between the two.  And basic 3 does the exact same. So \nunfortunately unlike Zhu Yuan we don’t   get any fancy basic skipping combos or anything, \nbut if I missed something please let me know.  However we will still use these \nlater on to our advantage. Her Special throws out a grenade, applying \na small amount of anomaly. Her EX applies 2   times the amount as well as throwing out \ntwo grenades, in total applying about 4   times the amount of anomaly as a normal Special.\nBut since her combo is very quick and her Core   passive still buffs the anomaly application of \nthe normal Specials, we can use them just fine   unlike most units. The DMG and Daze are much lower \nnaturally, but for an anomaly unit, that’s A-OK. One thing I love about the EX Specials that you \nmight miss is that because they have two grenades,   they won’t be wasted for anomaly application. If \na move has a separate multiplier value from what I   can tell, it can continuously apply anomaly. There \nis still the 3 second ICD though. So although this   enemy is nearly Shocked, throwing my EX Shocks \nthem and still reapplies some Electric Anomaly.   Unlike Piper’s big slamdunk that is one final MV \nand cannot have any excess anomaly application. So these Special attacks are very quick and \ncan also be used to maneuver when using them,   so you can go forward backwards \nsideways all during the Specials,   allowing you to get closer to the enemy. \nThis is important because you can actually   miss shots on your basic strings when you’re \ntoo far away. And so because of all this,   and the fact that we won’t interrupt her basic \nattack combo, we can now weave in Specials   into her basic string. This all meshes \nin together to create her first combo. So her basic 1 and 2 generate 3 stacks of \nZap each. Her basic 3 generates 5 stacks.   Her movement basics and her dash attacks \ngenerate 3 each. And her final basic,   basic 4, generates a whole 8 stacks alone. \nAnd remember, we want to hit 8 for the core   passive. Since basic 4 does this alone, the \nmain focus of Grace’s combos is to generate   at least 8 stacks of Zap before her final Basic \nattack. Maybe even 16 with a super saucy combo. Her most generic combo will thus be basic 1 2 \n3, Special or EX basic 4 Special or EX. This   generates 8 Zap stacks, uses a Special and then \nthe final basic always generates 8 Zap stacks,   so we can get our upgraded Special yet again. \nFeel free to use movement inputs during your   Specials to get closer to the enemy as her \ncombo does shoot her backwards somewhat. Now remember her movement inputs can \nadd extra attacks in between basics.   These generate 3 each. And her basic 3 \ngenerates 5. So we can now do another   combo for 3 Zap uses in one, splitting it \ninto 3 sections, one section per Special. Part 1 is Basic 1 2, movement \nbasic or dash attack, Special.  Part 2 basic 3, movement basic or dash attack, \nSpecial. By generating 9 in the first part,   we allow basic 3 to generate its full \n5 Zap stacks, and with an extra attack   in between that and basic 4, we can now \nabuse a final Zap Special, before part 3.  And so Part 3, we have our basic 4 which \nas always will guarantee a Zap Special. You can do a mix and match of \ncombos with your basic 1 and 2,   all you need to remember is to finish with \nsomething alongside basic 3 for 8 Stacks of Zap,   and then basic 4 for another 8 \nstacks. You can also use your   directional inputs to get closer to the \nenemy to not miss out on Zap charges. So those are your combos. Now I would not \nrecommend spamming your Special button.   Yes it applies anomaly technically, but you \nmiss out on the 130% buildup multiplier. But   you also miss out on the Decibels and energy \nprovided from your basic string. So not only   does it slow down your ultimate generation, \nit slows down your EX generation which   applies much more anomaly. Furthermore \nthis weakens her additional ability. I don’t think the rest of her kit is too relevant. \nHer chain is a lot of anomaly but isn’t anything   special. Her ultimate is a lot of anomaly but in \nmy opinion, you don’t want to ult on Grace. If   using her as a sub DPS for your Anton, an ult \non Anton would rather be used as you already   have plenty of Shock application. If using her \nas a dual DPS with another Anomaly like Piper,   I’d rather use a Support’s ultimate for the \nlarge energy generation. But let me know   if someone’s figured out the optimal \nultimate usage for the anomaly team. Her additional ability finally gives a Shock \nDMG% after hitting an enemy with an EX Special,   up to 2 stacks. This is a lot of free DMG and \nso maintaining good EX generation is important. Onto mindscapes, and we’ll \ngo through these quickly. Her M1 is a bunch of free energy generation, \nit’s nice to have since her combos are very   quick. She can dash in, do her combo, \nget an extra 2 energy for the whole team,   and dip out. This is another reason why her \nfull combo is better than Special spamming. M2 is some free damage from the \nElectric RES reduction as well   as faster anomaly application \nfrom the buildup RES reduction. M4 grants her even more energy generation. \nAfter an EX, 6 basics or dash attacks can   get a 1.2x energy multiplier. Energy \nGeneration Rate is the better energy   stat out of the two by the way. With our full \ncombo we can in fact use all stacks in one,   as we use 4 basics and 2 movement basics \nor dash attacks, for 6 uses in total. Finally her M6 grants an enormous \nDMG buff. 1 extra grenade for   1.5x the amount of anomaly and \ndamage and decibel generation,   as well as doubling the base multiplier \nvalue of each grenade. Amazing finale. Let’s check out Grace’s builds now. She \nis a bit of a weird one as she has two   team types and some sets can look better or \nworse than they actually are. So let’s see. If we look at disk drives, the two that we \nnaturally would think are good for her are   Thunder Metal and Freedom Blues. Thunder \nMetal offers a 10% electric DMG buff,   and then an insanely high 28% Combat ATK \nbuff when an enemy in combat is Shocked.  So the first ever shock you do won’t be buffed, \nbecause Anomaly DMG snapshots your stats for each   amount of application you do, and if the enemy \nisn’t shocked, your anomaly application isn’t   getting that 28% Combat ATK. This does mean her \n2nd Shock will be monstrously strong. But then   comes another problem of how this set works \nalong with Disorder. If you consume the Shock   with Disorder, bye bye 28% for your next Shock, \nremoving this set’s value nearly completely. Freedom Blues offers an Anomaly Proficiency \nbuff, and then applies a 20% buildup RES   Reduction to the equipper’s attribute onto the \nenemy. This is a 1.2x multiplicative increase   to your anomaly buildup and that sounds strong \nright? But then you have to remember that too   much application isn’t necessarily a good thing. \nBecause she already applies a bunch of anomaly,   and applying a 2nd Shock very quickly would \nonly override the old one and waste ticks. Two   of the same anomaly doesn’t cause disorder \nafter all. Furthermore in mono electric,   you’d just be giving your Anton and Rina a \nlarger share of Electric anomaly contribution,   which is also not ideal. However in the \ncase you can abuse this set, say a Disorder   However there is a final set we can use. \nFanged Metal. The 2 piece is useless on Grace,   but the 4 piece on a Piper Grace \nDisorder team actually works.   Grace will apply Shock, Piper will \nconsume it and apply Disorder and Assault,   and then Grace will get a 35% DMG buff for a lot \nof her next Shock’s application provided you swap   back onto her within 12 seconds. Thunder Metal \nwouldn’t work because the anomaly was consumed,   but Fanged Metal builds off of the \nbrand new anomaly that was applied. So here are all the sets calculated, all \nin their good or bad states as they are   very varying. In mono electric, use Thunder \nMetal, but in Disorder, use Freedom Blues,   and in Electric Physical Disorder \nyou can even try Fanged Metal. For main stats run Anomaly \nProficiency on Disk 4, ATK% is OK too.  Run Electric DMG on Disk 5, where \nPEN% can be best if running with   Rina and ideally Grace’s signature weapon.\nFinally run ATK% or Anomaly Mastery on Disk   6. Anomaly Mastery is technically just stronger \nsince it provides a faster anomaly application,   but you get the same problem as before where \nyou don’t necessarily need faster application   in a mono team. So in mono electric I would run \nATK%, but Mastery is viable in 2 Anomaly teams. Onto w-engines. Her Fusion Compiler is \nsynergistic with her Special spamming   playstyle. We get Combat ATK on top \nof stacking anomaly proficiency and   some PEN ratio as a main stat. A \nlot of big damage stats in one. Electro Lip Gloss is immense when there \nis an anomaly applied, and works in both   team variations. If you are hitting your \nvery first anomaly though or one wore off,   then you get a very weak w-engine. \nSo play smart, and it’s S rank tier. Rainforest Gourmet gives an excellent \nmega ATK buff for another great option   and is completely free to play.\nAnd Weeping Gemini works really   well in both team variations but can fall \noff as well. The buff is permanent until the   target dies or recovers from Stun. So into \na boss fight, this can stack up to quite a   large amount. I still prefer Rainforest \nas it's much safer and more consistent. And finishing with teams we have the super \nchill Rina Anton Grace team. This is a very   burst quick swappy team that enables \nlong and powerful Shocks from Grace,   to subsequently allow Anton’s passive to go ham \nwith massive Shock mini detonations. Lots of   buffs all around to the whole squad. A stun \nvariation would be replacing Rina for Anby,   trading damage amp for much \nbetter Daze accumulation,   so I’m not sure which is best as I don’t have \nthe resources to test all these teams just yet.  For a bangboo I would go with Safety here, as \nyou don’t need the extra anomaly application   from a Bangboo, and so you’d instead opt for \nhigher Bangboo damage, where Safety would be   higher according to IWTL. But you can’t go wrong \nwith Electro or Plugboo if you already got them. There is the Piper Grace Disorder team \nnext. Rina or Lucy or Anby can be in the   third slot. Rina offers the best shock \ndamage and some extra help applying it,   Lucy offers the best buffs but doesn’t help either \nanomaly, and Anby is just the best for Dazing. In   this case I would go Plugboo or Electroboo \nfor further help with shock application. Some people like running a Fire Disorder \ncomposition with Lucy and Koleda which   offers damage amping and Daze accumulation, \nbut Koleda nor Lucy have insane anomaly   damage or application themselves, so \nI don’t know how potent this team is. Anyways I hope you enjoyed Grace’s guide, and if \nyou did make sure to spread the love with a like,   sub, and share. Thanks for watching \neveryone, and have a guoba day!\n</video_transcript>\n"

misinformation spreading around in the zena Zone Z Community right now everyone is breaking their account you have to watch this immediately immediately watch this before it's too L as a completely free to play player in Zena Zone [Music] Zer hey guys here back with another video it has been a hot minute ever since I got sent to the shadow Realms by the Elden ring DLC brain Rod but we are once again back again and this is a very very very important video that I wanted to make basically farming Drive discs at level 35 might actually be the optimal use of your stamina so without further Ado let's get into today's content what exactly the hell am I talking about how in God's name am I going to spend stamina especially as a free to play I'm completely free to play Z as a free to play player in Z how the hell am I spending stamina on Drive discs at level 35 J you be dumping everything into tracers should you be dumping everything into character levels W engine levels why the hell would anyone in their right mind spend stamina on Drive discs this early into the game first of all I want to set a little bit of a context so this video is specifically for players who are not playing the game just for their husband bundles and wles all right this video is specifically for players that actually want to min max their stamina usage you care about efficiency you are either a free to play or will it doesn't matter but ultimately it will impact your overall progression in the game and second point to note is that this will only impact you if you are rushing to finish the refreshable shiu defense by the end of the month as a complete free to play I have already beaten this stage uh insane uh this is the stage that actually refreshes right so this stage right here time until the end operation is going to be 16 days right 16 days so everyone else if you are not within these kind of players uh you can you can you can move on right but hey feel free to stay to the end of the video because you know I spent a billion dollars on Firefly and I'm completely broke anyways so why would I say use your stamina your precious precious stamina in the cleanup domain in the cavern of corrosion in The Relic dungeons well here is the reason why right here is a reason why as you guys can see Point number one even at level 35 you are able to access the level 40 domain this level 50 domain it unlocks at level 45 it doesn't unlock at level 40 level 40 changes nothing you are going to be farming the same stage level 40 at level 35 or level 40 so that's number one right get that for that's number one number two if you go back into the hi Club these tracers they upgrade per 10 levels right so 30 when you reach 40 you're going to get 40 and when you reach 50 you're going to right so this unlock per 10 levels The Relic domains is five levels in between so this is where a little bit of numbers are going to come into play the math zener Zone zero leveling requirements shout out to my man qua for pulling this up and helping me compound this I have already gotten this thought at the back of my head I feel like something is up and with this hopefully you guys can share this with your friends your family members anyone that is playing zener Zone zero looking to optimize their stamina usage so what exactly is it that I have discovered these are the amount of loot you will obtain for 20 stamina so from level 30 to 40 these are the average drop rate that you're obtaining here right in terms of purple experience right this is the column for 30 to 40 and this is the column for 40 to 50 notice how there is a significant significant increase from agent promotions and agent skills a more than 50% increase in returns if you were to farm them from level 40 to level 50 some of the other stuff not that much of a difference but agent promotion specifically it goes up by a lot and keep in mind this this is per 20 stamina so absolutely insane absolutely insane so if you don't want to care about this you can just skip right into this right these are the map and how much it takes right so these are basically how much it takes for you to uh basically it takes a [ __ ] t almost a million dollars a million Denis but this is the important part before people take this off contest or say I'm spending Miss Mission you should still farm for tracers but do not prearm tracers it is highly advisable that you don't stash up free Farm them and instantly when you hit Level 40 you instantly make your agent's level 50 pre farming in Z is not worth it and what else should you be doing besides pre farming Drive discs right and here is the reason why total stamina you would have taken to upgrade a single agent with five skills maxed out this is take assuming that you bring them from Level 7 night right cuz when you reach level 40 you upgrade your Asian levels and W engine levels from level 40 to level 50 and then your tracers your skills it goes from Level 7 to level 9 so it takes you roughly 1, 14836 for stamina to max out if you were to prearm them from level 30 to 40 if you were to not prearm them and you only started farming at level 40 to 50 it quite literally cost you 2/3 of the stamina required it saves you almost 500 stamina for a single unit I'm not sure about you guys but as a free topl player myself 500 stamina is more than one day worth of free topl income it's almost two whole days worth and this is for a single unit so as you guys can clearly see pre farming for tracers at this point is legitimately not worth it I want to take this a step further now this might be me going like absolutely skito this might be me going absolutely crazy I wouldn't even recommend players to farm up their second team before level 40 this is a little bit of a hypothetical situation right I think the best way the absolute best way to use a stamina you still do your tracers tracers tra TR tracers up until Level 35 so from Level 1 to level 35 you only focus on a team of threee from Level 35 to 40 you start farming your relics you start farming your drive discs and then from level 40 onwards then you start bringing your team of tree to level 50 and your second team to level 50 as well the reason is very simple this thing over here it does not refresh it is a onetime clear event the only thing that matters is this this refreshes but it refreshes at the end of the month whether you raise up your second team today or next week or two weeks later it has no difference whatsoever cuz it literally just takes you one clear and you're done so a player raising up their second team earlier on their second team is quote unquote worthless because you could say yeah I want to build my second team earlier so that I could tackle this earlier right but there's no point in tackling this earlier because these things do not refresh and if you were to prematurely build your second team it's not like you're going to go very far here anyways your two teams of level 40 units PR play by by the way uh it's not going to get you very very far that brings us back to opportunity cost instead of doing that where you are pre farming your not pre farming but you're farming and building your second team right now you could just build your second team from level 40 onwards because I am completely free to play and I am reaching level 42 completely free to play and there is still 16 days remaining before this thing resets if within 16 days you could completely raise up your second team then it would have saved you a lot a lot of stamina uh so if you can take a look over here this is required from 1 to 50 from 1 to 50 if you were to raise a unit at level 40 it would have only taken you 1, 158 stamina but this is for a unit with five skills and as you have know from zenone zero most of the time the only unit that you want five skills maxed out is going to be your main DPS so for support and sustain most of the time you only care about like a single skill or maybe two skills right your assist and a skill that's it you will never pretty much never use the ultimate the Bas is very very not frequent and the dodg is not it doesn't matter that much you can say that if you were to save your stamina save your building of the second team until Level 40 it quite literally saves you 800 stamina that is almost three full days worth of stamina we have around 4,800 stamina from right now today as the time this recording which is uh 15 of July to 16 days when the thing resets so if you can build up your second team which is three units and like I said you don't need all them to get Max skills you would have saved a lot a lot a lot of stamina so that is the gist of where I'm going Do Not Free Farm and you might even consider not building a second team until level 40 because at level 40 it saves you a hell of a lot of resources right so between level 35 to 40 which is where you unlock the New Relic domain that's when I believe players should start investing their stamina into these Relic domains because we will have enough stamina here to fully raise up a unit from Level 1 to 50 based on these criter over here so between 35 to 40 farming relics will be the best B of buck because the moment you're done with Relic right and we're not aiming for like God Ste St we just want the right main whatever you're done the next upgrade for your Relic is at level 45 and above can you not Farm relics for that long yeah sure [ __ ] it I'm just not going to farm relics for 10 or levels I'm just going to prearm even more but as you can see pre farming is already quote unquote a stamina deficit you are already pre- farming at a 33% net loss imagine this difference when you hit Level 50 and unlock the final stage I hope what I'm saying here makes sense in my opinion which is what I'm doing right now as a free to play I feel that I have lowkey uh wasted a little bit of stamina right cuz today today as of this recording 16th of July I cleared B 10 and I can't really go past this that much uh I I got completely destroyed by this stage I I I was barely even clearing the first off right I completely [ __ ] destroyed this shows me that I really had no sense of urgency in building my second team if I had only just waited to build my second team when I reach level 40 it would have saved me a lot more stamina I don't really care if I don't tackle this right now it doesn't matter to me because this thing never refreshes as long as I cleared this and this by the end of the month I would have gotten the exact same amount of rewards while saving 30% of my stamina cost if I were to build my units my second team at level 40 onwards in my opinion I feel like I slowkey break my account I am now currently dumping all of my Stam into the reg domains and let's just keep it a b having the right Main St on your DPS especially at S rank it changes a lot previously I was like running running this this attack percentage uh this 12.5% into this nuclear 30% attack it made quite a significant difference when it comes to my overall clearing and this one over here this used to be my my piece create damage and now I got this randomized piece not the best but I still got it right not to say that getting good relics is your priority but I would say that having the right Main that it does make difference when it comes to you clearing the stages it make a lot of difference for me actually cuz at this point all of my tracers are more I can't really improve them anymore so the only thing I can improve right now if I want to clear them is to do rics that's it right this is pretty much the end of my tin foil head Theory I think just to kind of wrap up a little bit in case you guys are you know still a little bit confused you should still farm for your skills especially your main team especially your main DPS you definitely Farm for your your tra and talents but it's not worth it to prearm for your level 50 because it it literally cost you 30% more stamina if you were to do it here right opportunity cost opportunity cost the the stages they're not going away until the end of the month so you literally have the end of the month to get a unit to level 50 whether you do it today or you do it next week it doesn't matter right what matters that you're losing 30% of the stamina if you were to prearm also your supports Frankly Speaking even if they level 40 it's completely [ __ ] fine 90% of the time the one on your field is your main DPS so even if they level 40 is completely fine as long as your main DPS goes from level 40 to level 50 it will make a significant difference when it comes to clearing speed uh do you think we should prepare for Danny's Cur experience and go on on drive this I feel you don't have to because if we go by the assumption that you only raise your main D to level 50 it's not a lot of uh it doesn't cost that much money you know it doesn't cost that much uh this level is 45,000 I have 1.3 million as a complete free play I know some of these are kind of expensive I think this is like 60,000 but for a single unit that your main DPS you don't really need to specifically fund for zenis or Denis just for your main DPS unless you're telling me you want to raise every single one of your teammates to level 50 or you completely [ __ ] your life and you buil up like seven units eight units nine units then this this guy is not for you if you break your account by building like nine different units like this early uh this account is not for you uh at that point your account is really over right so that is that is something for you to consider some of you may be saying yo Mr if I would to spend my stamina farming Drive discs but they just turn out to be completely dark [ __ ] would I have just wasted all of my stamina just getting garbage relics that's completely unusable wrong why you shouldn't be looking at Drive disk farming from 35 to 40 as a means for you to get perfect Drive discs you should be seeing as okay I'm trying to get the right main set but even if I fail all these Drive discs that I'm farming now they can be used as Drive dis experience oh my God insane you are going to need dry disc experience if you want to take your dry discs to level 15 so you either Farm it now or you have the shortage in the future eventually especially when need six time 6 36 different drive this to level 15 eventually there's honestly no loss it's is a good that you get a right main stat even better if you get the right main stat with the right substat it is even better if you get right main stat right substat on on the right set but even if you don't get all these completely do shift Drive discs can still be used as experience so there's ultimately no net loss for you so with that knowledge in mind you're probably wondering hey Mr Pokey the rank one zone zero for to play where the [ __ ] should I farm there's so many different domains so where the [ __ ] should I be spending my stamina from Level 35 to level 40 and the answer to that question is very simple stay tuned to the next video where I'll be going through Dy disc inan Z insane feel free to let me know what you guys think in the comments below uh is it more efficient is it not efficient should you prearm should not prearm in my opinion it's not worth it but I'm open to suggestion right so one last time I'm going to pull up the map over here so that you guys can kind of take a screenshot and just kind of reference this to your to your own liking right all right so yeah that's pretty much it uh with that we have come to the end of today's content let me know what you guys in the comments below want to join my Discord discord. for Z on daily basis my. all the best for LM Po and I'll see you guys next time take care n [Music]\n</video_transcript>"

I'll summarize the key points using the appropriate markdown format:\n\n## Key information the video was trying to say\n- Players should consider farming Drive Disks (relics) from level 35 to 40, instead of pre-farming tracers or building a second team\n- Pre-farming tracers before level 40 is inefficient, as it costs about 33% more stamina compared to farming at level 40-50\n- The level 40 domain for Drive Disks is accessible at level 35, and doesn't change until level 45\n- Building a second team before level 40 may not be necessary, as the Shuyu Defense refreshes monthly regardless of when you clear it\n- Farming Drive Disks from 35-40 can provide the right main stats for your DPS, improving clear times\n- Even if you get \"bad\" Drive Disks, they can be used as experience fodder for upgrading good ones later\n\n## How important is this information and who is it for\n- This information is highly important for free-to-play and low-spending players who want to optimize their stamina usage and game progression\n- It's crucial for players aiming to clear the refreshable Shuyu Defense by the end of the month\n- Target players: Mid-game players (around level 35-40) who are focused on efficient resource management and maximizing their team's power\n\nAdditional tips:\n- Focus on leveling your main team (especially main DPS) to 50 after reaching level 40\n- Don't neglect farming for your main DPS's tracers and talents\n- Support characters can remain at level 40 for now, as the main DPS is on the field 90% of the time\n- Consider the opportunity cost of pre-farming or building multiple units too early\n- Be mindful of the stamina and resource requirements for leveling characters and their skills\n\nThe video creator suggests that while this strategy may not be for everyone (especially those who prioritize building multiple characters early), it can significantly improve resource efficiency for players looking to optimize their progress."
